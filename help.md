Hello Erin. I like how everything is laid out here on your page. I am, however, encountering an issue. It appears as though you have an error when it comes to properly processing the time. I'm getting an error in the console regarding the variable firstTime. 

This is an issue of scope. Your firstTime variable is defined only within your submit event handler. 

If you get this working, let me know and I can update your grade.
